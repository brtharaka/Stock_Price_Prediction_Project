# Stock Price Prediction Project 📈

This project uses machine learning to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses a historical stock dataset contained in `stock_data.csv`, which includes daily stock market data for a single publicly traded company.

Each row represents one trading day, and the dataset includes the following columns:

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Date**      | The date of the trading session (in YYYY-MM-DD format) |
| **Open**      | The stock's price at the market opening |
| **High**      | The highest price reached during the trading session |
| **Low**       | The lowest price reached during the trading session |
| **Close**     | The stock's price at the market close |
| **Adj Close** | The closing price adjusted for dividends and stock splits |
| **Volume**    | The total number of shares traded on that day |

The dataset spans a significant time range and is ideal for:
- 📈 Time series forecasting
- 🧠 Machine learning model training
- 🔍 Trend and pattern detection in stock movements

It serves as the foundation for building and evaluating predictive models aimed at forecasting future stock prices.
